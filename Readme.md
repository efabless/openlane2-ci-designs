# OpenLane CI Designs

These are designs used in the testing of OpenLane 2 or higher.

They are not meant to serve as a reference *per se*. Matter of fact is, some of
them are pretty bad. But they do exercise crucial functionality in OpenLane.

# License

Each design has its own license. You may check the source headers for the files
for said license.

If a file lacks a license and/or something is unclear, feel free to file an issue
in the [OpenLane repository](https://github.com/efabless/openlane2).
